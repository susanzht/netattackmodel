# Transformer-based Network Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project explores the development and application of a **Transformer-based machine learning model** for network anomaly detection. The goal is to identify anomalies in network traffic, such as security breaches or system faults, by analyzing patterns within the traffic data. Transformers, a powerful architecture primarily used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), are leveraged to address the challenges of network traffic analysis.

The model is trained on multiple well-known network datasets like **NSL-KDD**, **KDDCUP99**, and **CICIDS2017** to ensure high adaptability and performance across different network environments. The transformer architecture allows for robust detection of complex patterns and anomalies, improving over traditional methods such as statistical analysis and signature-based detection.

## Problem Definition
Network anomaly detection is essential in cybersecurity for identifying potential security threats like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, data exfiltration, and malware propagation. Anomalies can also result from faults within network systems, such as equipment malfunctions or misconfigurations. Traditional methods for anomaly detection often struggle with the complexity and dynamic nature of modern networks, necessitating the use of advanced models.

## Key Features
- **Robust Model**: Achieves over 99% accuracy in anomaly detection across diverse datasets.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The transformer architecture allows the model to focus on key features, improving detection accuracy.
- **Adaptability**: Capable of adapting to evolving network traffic and reducing the need for frequent retraining.
- **Explainability**: Offers insights into anomaly detection, assisting in root cause analysis.

## Datasets
- **NSL-KDD**: A widely used dataset for benchmarking network intrusion detection systems.
- **KDDCUP99**: A classic dataset from the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program.
- **CICIDS2017**: A dataset created by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, simulating modern attack scenarios in network environments.

## Model Architecture
- **Linear Embedding Layer**: Converts input features into a higher-dimensional space for processing by the transformer.
- **Transformer Encoder**: Consists of three layers with a self-attention mechanism that analyzes the network traffic data and identifies patterns.
- **Classifier**: A linear layer that classifies the network traffic into normal or anomalous categories.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Data Processing**: Pandas
- **Modeling**: Transformer Architecture, AdamW Optimizer, Cross-Entropy Loss

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Over 99% accuracy achieved across different datasets.
- **Loss Reduction**: Significant reduction in loss during training, indicating the model's ability to learn complex patterns in the network data.
- **Generalization**: Strong performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating the model's robustness and adaptability to various network conditions.

## Conclusion
The implementation of the Transformer-based anomaly detection model marks a significant step forward in network security, particularly in handling the complexity and dynamism of modern network traffic. The model demonstrates high efficacy in detecting both security-related anomalies and system faults, making it an essential tool for maintaining network reliability and compliance with security regulations.
